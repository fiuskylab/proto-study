# proto-study
Step-by-step on how to implement gRPC in a simple API.

## Proposition
- A simple user CRUD
- The database will be a JSON file

## Step-by-step
### 1. Initiating Go mod
- Go modules will allow us to easily add third-party/external packages
- > $ go mod init <your_url>
- In my case, the URL that I'll be using is the same of this repository so the command will be something like:
- > $ go mod init github.com/fiuskylab/proto-study
